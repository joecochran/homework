# MINDBODY FEE Challenge
My work on the MINDBODY Frontend Engineer Challenge from [https://github.com/MINDBODY-FEE/homework]

## Requirements
- npm
- grunt

## Installation
1. `git clone git@github.com:joecochran/homework.git`
2. Grunt should be installed globally, so run `npm install -g grunt-cli`
3. Once Grunt is installed, install node_modules with `npm install`
4. Compile all assets in src/ by running `grunt`
5. Compiled site can be found in dist/ directory.

## Styles
Using BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology to organize css into components.
The `src/less/` directory contains all less for the project. `src/less/boilerplate` contains a sliced up version of the html5boilerplate css. `src/less/components` contains individual "blocks" in the BEM methodology.
